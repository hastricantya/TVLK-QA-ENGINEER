// Wait for the game UI loaded
Wait until the game UI is fully loaded

// Start timer
startTime = GetCurrentTime()

currentNumber = 1 // Start with number 1, which the game requires clicking numbers in order

While currentNumber <= 50:
    // Find the element containing the current number
    // Assumes the game's HTML structure uses identifiable elements for each number
    numberElement = Find element on the page with text equal to currentNumber
    
    If numberElement exists:

endTime = GetCurrentTime()

// Calculate the total duration
totalDuration = endTime - starTime
