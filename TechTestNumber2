Question: 
Analyze anomaly on screenshot below and elaborate whether itâ€™s a FE or BE bug.
a. Elaborate your analysis
b. Create the bug report.

Answer:
a. Elaborate your analysis
Elaborate Analysis:
Currently user on Accommodations Landing Page
Then, user search for "Jakarta" Region, Stay date on "Sat, 30 Apr 2022", for "1 night" and "1 room", "1 adult", and "0 children"
After click search, then the result is:
Showing result in "Bali" Region
And then on the header only showing stay date (30 Apr 2022), 1 night, and 1 room.

From analysis the bug comes from Backend. Because, the frontend only consumes every data that comes from the backend and it affects the result not expected by the request search.

b. Create the bug report
